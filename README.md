## Introduction
I am a front-end web developer using HTML and CSS. I am an intermediate-advanced Skripter. I am practicing Java. I've programmed for many servers over 3 years of development. I've had experience in a lot of shit haha
```python
class Almond:
  def __init__(self, pronouns, name, age, tools):
    self.name = name
    self.pronouns = pronouns
    self.tools = tools

  def Almond(self):
    print("Name:", self.name)
    print("Pronouns:", self.pronouns)
    print("Tools:", self.tools)
    

Almond = Almond("She/Her", "Almond", "VS Code, Intellij")
Almond.Almond()
```
```md
Name: Almond
Pronouns: She/Her
Tools: VS Code, Intellij
```
