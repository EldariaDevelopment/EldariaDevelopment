<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I am an intermediate Skripter, trying to make help the community everywhere I go. I am practicing Java, JavaScript, And HTML. I've developed countless servers over a span of 3 years of development.</p>

```python
class Almond:
  def __init__(self, pronouns, name, age, tools):
    self.name = name
    self.pronouns = pronouns
    self.tools = tools

  def Almond(self):
    print("Name:", self.name)
    print("Pronouns:", self.pronouns)
    print("Tools:", self.tools)
    

Almond = Almond("She/Her", "Almond", "VS Code, Intellij")
Almond.Almond()
```
```md
Name: Almond
Pronouns: She/Her
Tools: VS Code, Intellij
